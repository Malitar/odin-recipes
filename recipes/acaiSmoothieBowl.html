     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>This is a delicious breakfast smoothie bowl. My kids like it so I sweeten it with honey, but you can use agave
          as well for a vegan version or not sweeten it at all. Top the smoothie bowls with some granola for crunch,
          nuts, or other berries of your choosing.</p>
     <p>Just go for it.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
          <li>7 ounces frozen unsweetened acai pulp, partially defrosted in refrigerator overnight</li>
          <li>2 medium ripe frozen bananas</li>
          <li>1 cup blueberries</li>
          <li>Â¾ cup almond milk, or more as needed</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons honey, or to taste</li>
          <ul>Topping
               <li>1 medium banana, sliced</li>
               <li>2 tablespoons fresh blueberries, or to taste</li>
               <li>1 tablespoon pomegranate seeds, or to taste</li>
               <li>1 tablespoon large coconut flakes, or to taste</li>
          </ul>
     </ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
          <li>Combine acai, bananas, blueberries, almond milk, and honey in a blender. Blend until smooth. Smoothie
               should have a thick consistency, like frozen yogurt.</li>
          <li>Pour into 2 bowls and top with banana slices, blueberries, pomegranate seeds, and coconut.</li>
     </ol>
